# Deposit Assets using Faucet

The next step is to acquire some funds in your wallet. To mint tokens on the Fuel network, you'll need to have some ETH in your wallet to pay transaction fees. There are two ways to obtain ETH:

1. Via the Fuel [faucet link](https://faucet-beta-5.fuel.network/).
2. Via the [Spark Faucet](https://app.sprk.fi/#/faucet), representing a table with all tokens supported by our platform, including UNI, USDC, BTC, LINK, and any other in the near future. Note that to mint any token other than ETH, you must first have some ETH in your wallet.
