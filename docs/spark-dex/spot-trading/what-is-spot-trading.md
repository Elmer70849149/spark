# What is Spot Trading?

Spot trading involves the immediate purchase or sale of assets, with on-chain settlement, resulting in instant confirmation and an immediate reflection of the asset's change in your account balances.&#x20;

In Spark , spot trading utilizes liquidity from Spark CLOB. It's important to note that margin trading is not enabled by default, and you can find instructions on how to activate it in the following section.&#x20;

1. Select the UNI / USDC market in the top bar or the market's menu
